# Dual-Zone Temperature Monitoring System (ESP32-based)

## Overview

This project implements a dual-zone temperature monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller. It reads temperatures from two DS18B20 sensors and displays the readings on an SSD1306 OLED screen. If either temperature exceeds 30Â°C, a buzzer and LED are activated as alerts.

## Features

- Dual-zone temperature tracking
- Real-time OLED display
- Buzzer and LED alerts for high temperatures
- Simulated using Wokwi platform

## Components

- ESP32 microcontroller
- 2x DS18B20 temperature sensors
- SSD1306 OLED display
- Buzzer
- LED
